Heroku Application Link: https://flaskshoppingcart.herokuapp.com

This is a web app developed using Flask, HTML/CSS and SQLite. 
It consists of a shopping store with 4 fruits available, namely Apple, Banana, Orange and Watermelon. The costs are stored as constants. 

The user is allowed to add quantities of each of these fruit items. This is done using a numerical input field. The user can also delete the quantities of items that they added.

However, they cannot add their own fruits to the store. 

The application computes the total cost and total quantity of fruits in the userâ€™s cart, as and when they add/delete from their cart.

The application also computes an Order Summary table, which includes the taxes and delivery fees.
